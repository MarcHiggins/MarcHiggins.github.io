				Here are some facts about the human genome sequencing project
				</h3>
				<ul> 
					<li>
					The human genome project was a publically funded project, beginning in 1990, to uncover the DNA sequence of the human genome.
					</li>
					<li>
					Initally this project was met with uncertainty due to the huge costs involved, and at the time uncertain benefits of sequencing genomes.
					</li>
					<li>
					The project was a worldwide collaboration, lead by the NIH in the US and the Sanger institute in the UK.
					</li>
					<li>
					The method of sequencing used was termed hierarchical shotgun sequencing. Whereby libraries were created by ligating restriction enzyme fragmented were mapped to chromosomal regions
					</li>
					<li>
					A draft sequence was published in 2001 and a "complete" sequence was published in 2003.
					</li>
					<li>
					This draft sequence excluded telomeric regions for example, and other repetitive chromosomal regions.
					</li>
				</ul>
